/// Lower level networking interface that more closely mirrors the standard
/// Berkeley sockets model.  Sockets are hard!  You should probably only use
/// this interface under the existing circumstances:
///
/// - You have an existing socket-based codebase you want to port, or coexist with.
/// - You want to be able to connect based on IP address, rather than (just) Steam ID.
/// - You need low-level control of bandwidth utilization, when to drop packets, etc.
///
/// Note that neither of the terms "connection" and "socket" will correspond
/// one-to-one with an underlying UDP socket.  An attempt has been made to
/// keep the semantics as similar to the standard socket model when appropriate,
/// but some deviations do exist.

{
public:

	/// Creates a "server" socket that listens for clients to connect to, either by calling
	/// ConnectSocketBySteamID or ConnectSocketByIPv4Address.
	///
	/// nSteamConnectVirtualPort specifies how clients can connect to this socket using
	/// ConnectBySteamID.  A negative value indicates that this functionality is
	/// disabled and clients must connect by IP address.  It's very common for applications
	/// to only have one listening socket; in that case, use zero.  If you need to open
	/// multiple listen sockets and have clients be able to connect to one or the other, then
	/// nSteamConnectVirtualPort should be a small integer constant unique to each listen socket
	/// you create.
	///
	/// In the open-source version of this API, you must pass -1 for nSteamConnectVirtualPort
	///
	/// If you want clients to connect to you by your IPv4 addresses using
	/// ConnectByIPv4Address, then you must set nPort to be nonzero.  Steam will
	/// bind a UDP socket to the specified local port, and clients will send packets using
	/// ordinary IP routing.  It's up to you to take care of NAT, protecting your server
	/// from DoS, etc.  If you don't need clients to connect to you by IP, then set nPort=0.
	/// Use nIP if you wish to bind to a particular local interface.  Typically you will use 0,
	/// which means to listen on all interfaces, and accept the default outbound IP address.
	/// If nPort is zero, then nIP must also be zero.

	///
	/// Use ConnectBySteamID to connect using the SteamID (client or game server) as the network address.
	/// Use ConnectByIPv4Address to connect by IP address.

	/// Accept an incoming connection that has been received on a listen socket.
	///
	/// When a connection attempt is received (perhaps after a few basic handshake
	/// packets have been exchanged to prevent trivial spoofing), a connection interface
	/// object is created in the k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connecting state
	/// and a SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t is posted.  At this point, your
	/// application MUST either accept or close the connection.  (It may not ignore it.)
	/// Accepting the connection will transition it either into the connected state,
	/// of the finding route state, depending on the connection type.
	///
	/// You should take action within a second or two, because accepting the connection is
	/// what actually sends the reply notifying the client that they are connected.  If you
	/// delay taking action, from the client's perspective it is the same as the network
	/// being unresponsive, and the client may timeout the connection attempt.  In other
	/// words, the client cannot distinguish between a delay caused by network problems
	/// and a delay caused by the application.
	///
	/// This means that if your application goes for more than a few seconds without
	/// processing callbacks (for example, while loading a map), then there is a chance
	/// that a client may attempt to connect in that interval and fail due to timeout.
	///
	/// If the application does not respond to the connection attempt in a timely manner,
	/// and we stop receiving communication from the client, the connection attempt will
	/// be timed out locally, transitioning the connection to the
	/// k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ProblemDetectedLocally state.  The client may also
