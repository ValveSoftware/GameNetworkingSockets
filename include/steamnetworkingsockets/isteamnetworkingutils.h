	/// If you are running under the debugger and stop the process, the clock
	/// might not advance the full wall clock time that has elapsed between
	/// calls.  If the process is not blocked from normal operation, the
	/// timestamp values will track wall clock time, even if you don't call
	/// the function frequently.

	/// The value is only meaningful for this run of the process.  Don't compare
	/// it to values obtained on another computer, or other runs of the same process.
